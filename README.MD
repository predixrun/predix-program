# Predix - Cross-Chain Betting Protocol

## Overview
Predix is a decentralized cross-chain betting protocol built on the Solana blockchain with Wormhole interoperability. It enables seamless cross-chain betting and secure tokenized rewards using advanced smart contract mechanisms.

Predix leverages Anchor, Wormhole, and the Solana blockchain to create a trustless, efficient, and transparent betting ecosystem.

## Features

### âœ… Cross-Chain Betting with Wormhole
- Users can place bets across different chains through verified messages from Wormhole.
- The betting process ensures message integrity and authenticity using Wormhole's `Posted VAA`.

### âœ… On-Chain Betting System
- Secure betting directly on Solana with SPL token support.
- Market-based betting where users bet on predefined outcomes.

### âœ… Secure Token Transfers
- Uses Anchorâ€™s `Associated Token Accounts` and `Token2022` for managing bets securely.
- Implements secure token transfers between users and market vaults with transaction fee handling.

### âœ… Reward Distribution
- Winners receive automated payouts based on betting pool distribution.
- Reward APRs are calculated based on market conditions and distributed accordingly.

## How Predix Uses Solana & Wormhole

### ðŸ”¹ Cross-Chain Interoperability with Wormhole
- Messages from external chains are verified through Wormholeâ€™s `Posted VAA`.
- Uses the `ForeignEmitter` account to validate messages from trusted chains.

### ðŸ”¹ Trustless Betting System
- Smart contracts ensure the integrity of each bet.
- Betting is only allowed on approved and existing markets.

### ðŸ”¹ Secure & Efficient Token Management
- Users deposit SPL tokens into betting vaults.
- Fees and rewards are managed transparently using Anchorâ€™s token program.

### ðŸ”¹ Decentralized Reward Claiming
- Winning bets are verified based on market outcomes.
- Users can claim rewards without intermediaries.
